The gem implements two methods: [Simpsons's Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_rule) and [Euler's Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method). This gem was the product of frustration at the monotonous nature of summing integrals, and the unwieldily interfaces and UXs on most graphing calculators.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'calculose'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install calculose\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nSimpson's can be called thusly:\r\n\r\n    Calculose::Calc.simpson(deltaX, startingX, endingX) do |x| f(x) end\r\n\r\nwhere f(x) is the base function.\r\n\r\n\r\nEuler's can be called thusly:\r\n\r\n    Calculose::Calc.euler(deltaX, startingX, startingY, endingX) do |x,y| f(x) end\r\n    \r\nNote that **both x and y** are passed to the block by the function.\r\n\r\n##To do\r\n\r\n* CLI\r\n* More algorithms","name":"Calculose"}
